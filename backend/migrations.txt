!!!! If models are a new file make sure to include them in alembic/env.py before running migrations !!!!

* ps if db is wiped out or new, move the alembic/versions/* to backup and run the commands afterwards

* docker exec -it moyatapokana-db_writer-1 psql -U postgres -d app_db

docker exec -it moyatapokana-backend-1 alembic revision --autogenerate -m "latest migration"
docker exec -it moyatapokana-backend-1 alembic upgrade head
